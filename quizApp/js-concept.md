1. there is difference between selectAnswer and selectAnswer()

selectAnswer() - we are executing the function immediately
selectAnswer - we are passing the reference of the function so that its value can be stored in some other variable.


we can use it like:
() => selectAnswer(choice) to pass it reference to the other function
